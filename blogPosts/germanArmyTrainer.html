                <p>The German Army Trainer is a silhouette that dates back to the early 1900s and has roots in the need to outfit the German Army
                     with some trainers. Deciding who was responsible for this shoe is a touchy subject. It started with the Dassler Brothers, Adi
                      Dassler and his brother Rudolf began making sports shoes in 1924. They had been making shoes for 12 years before when they
                       coerced American sprinter Jesse Owens to wear their track shoes in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. This brought the spotlight to 
                       the shoe manufacturer.

                <p>Things were going well for the two of them until World War II, which caused stress and conflict between the brothers. Eventually, 
                    the two of them decided to start their own respective brands. Adi would go on to take his first name and the first three letters of
                     his last name and start Adidas, while Adolf went on to start Puma. During this time, the German Army was growing at a very fast rate.
                      They needed a way to get trainers on the feet of all of the soldiers. Not everyone agreed with the Nazi Army, however, the contracts 
                      involved would be great for anyone to sell so many shoes. So, it is a little bit up in the air about which company did most of the supplying
                       in the shoes as being associated with Nazi Germany is a little bit of a touchy relationship. Regardless, the shoes that were created under the
                        name BW Sport, and featured a sleek silhouette with a gum sole and suede toe guard. Adidas makes the same silhouette under the name Adidas
                         BW Army today, so make of that what you will.

                <p>	The GAT Sillhoutte very closely resembled the Adidas Samba and the Puma Palermo. With the recent rage of the Adidas Samba,
                     this has brought many collaborations and brought explore page warriors to at some points in 2023 drive the demand for the 
                     samba past the supply. Some notable collaborations with the Adidas Samba are the multiple Wales Bonner sneakers, Jonah Hill, 
                     Clarks, and even the creative director of Louis Vuitton’s brand Human Race.

                <p>	Now to escape this trend frenzy, some have been turning to Martin Margiela’s label Maison Margiela to enjoy his replica sneakers.
                     The sneakers are a 1:1 replica of the German Army Trainers originally created by BW Sport for the German Army during World War II.
                      The story goes that while Martin was in Belgium studying in Antwerp he found the BW Sport GAT and bought a selection of them and
                       resold them in one of his collections. Once he realized that it was difficult to source the GAT and he could remake them, the shoe
                        became a staple for the fashion house.

            <div class="articleText">
                <p>	There are still GATs circling in Europe and in the United States that you can find on sites like eBay and Grailed. 
                    Or you could look to get a Margiela Replica GAT, or even an Adidas Samba to get in on the classic silhouette.
