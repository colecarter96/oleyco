                <p>With the speed of trend cycles nowadays it can be easy to let some slip over our heads. Some receive names, 
                    some are such small microtrends that they only exist in small corners of the internet with it’s participants
                     not touching grass in days. Regardless there are some questions that can be asked and discussed when it comes to a new trend.

                <p>Starting with the first. What is Eclectic Grandpa Core?
                </p>

            <div class="articleText">
                <p>The Eclectic Grandpa Core or Style basically draws on the classic silhouettes and cuts that you would expect a grandpa to wear.
                     Straight to loose-fitting trousers and jeans, vests (both knitted and more structured fabrics), hats (beanies and dad hats), 
                     scarves, leather footwear, classic shades, and anything else a stylish grandpa might wear. I think another large aspect is mixing
                      colors well. Be it muted colors or tastefully blending in some pop of color here and there, the style revolves around color. I 
                      think that's what makes the Grandpa Eclectic. That and the importance of fitment. Making sure that everything fits very well. 
                      That is what is going to set you apart as an Eclectic Granpda and not just your run of the mill Grandpa.

                <p>	One could imagine that behind every Eclectic Grandpa is an eclectic Grandma in their lives to pick the clothes for them.

                <p>In terms of trend timeless, Grandpas have been dressing like this since the dawn of time. 
                    I’m sure there was a Caveman Grandpa who had his outerwear made out of a leopard coat. But in all seriousness, 
                    this is basically taking the most timeless pieces in both men's and womenswear and putting them together 
                    to dress as though you’ve been doing it for years. In some ways it is the result of someone honing their 
                    style for their whole life. So might it not be the most timeless trend of all??
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="articleText">
                <p>Okay so now that we know what the Eclectic Grandpa Core is and that its going to stick 
                    around if it's your thing, let's talk how you can achieve it and where to shop. First, with anything, 
                    know your measurements. Next, there are tiers of pricing.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="articleText">
                <p>First tier is always thrifting and buying second-hand. Even if your thrift store is dry going on eBay
                     and looking for things like vintage footwear, denim, trousers, vests, scarves, beanies, flannels, and other 
                     garments will always be great game. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="articleText">
                <p>Next, looking at brands like LL. Bean, Polo Ralph Lauren, Clarks, Levi’s, New Balance, Carhartt, and GH. Bass. 
                    These are going to be in that middle tier. Just to reiterate, fashion doesn’t have to cost money and just having 
                    money doesn’t guarantee something to be stylish. It’s more about personal style, fitment, and color combinations.

            <div class="articleText">
                <p>The Final Bosses of Eclectic Granpa core consists of Drake’s, Brooks Brothers, Jacques Marie Mage, Pendleton,
                     Barbour, Filson, Blundstone, Jacques Soloviere, Lemaire, Bronson MFG, Birkenstock, and others.
